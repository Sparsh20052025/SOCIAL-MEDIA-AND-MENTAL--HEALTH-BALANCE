 Social Media and Mental Health Balance

 Project Overview

This project explores how social media usage impacts mental health and emotional well-being. Using data-driven analysis and visualizations, it identifies potential correlations between time spent on social media platforms and self-reported mental health indicators.

The analysis involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends, distributions, and patterns that could help understand how online behavior affects psychological balance.

 Objectives

Analyze patterns between social media usage and mental health indicators.

Identify correlations between social media habits and emotional well-being.

Visualize insights using charts for better interpretation.

Build awareness around maintaining a healthy social–digital balance.



---

 Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes information about:

User demographics (age, gender, etc.)

Time spent on social media platforms

Self-assessed mental health or stress indicators


(If your dataset is from a public source like Kaggle, add the link here — e.g., “Dataset: Kaggle - Social Media and Mental Health Survey”)

 Technologies and Libraries

This project is implemented in Python using the following libraries:

pandas       # Data manipulation and analysis
numpy        # Numerical operations
matplotlib   # Data visualization
seaborn      # Statistical visualizations


---

 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The project performs:

Countplots to show the distribution of categorical data.

Violin plots to compare data distributions and detect patterns.

Correlation analysis to find relationships between usage and mental health.


Through EDA, the notebook visualizes how varying levels of social media usage relate to stress levels, happiness, and productivity.


---

 Insights & Conclusions

Excessive social media usage often correlates with higher stress or anxiety levels.

Balanced usage patterns show better emotional well-being.

Visualizations highlight trends across different age groups and genders.
